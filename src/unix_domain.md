# UNIX Domain Sockets

UNIX domain sockets can be used for local connection on *nix systems that implement them. They operate For that use the classes:

```cpp
unix_address
unix_connector
unix_acceptor
unix_socket
unix_stream_socket
unix_dgram_socket
```

Examples are in the [examples/unix](https://github.com/fpagliughi/sockpp/tree/master/examples/unix) directory.
