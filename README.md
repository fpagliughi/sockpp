# sockpp

Simple, modern, C++ network socket library.

_sockpp_ is a fairly low-level C++ wrapper around the Berkeley sockets library using `socket`, `acceptor,` and `connector` classes that are familiar concepts from other languages.

This branch contains the GitHub pages for the documentation as an mdBook. Simply add or update the Markdown files in the _src/_ directory. The top-level organization sits in the SUMMARY.md file.

The documentation is live here:
